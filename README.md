1. Working Directory (Your Computer)

Where you write and edit your code
Files are in their current state
Like your kitchen where you cook

2. Staging Area (Preparation Zone)

Where you prepare files for permanent saving
Files are ready to be committed
Like your prep table where you organize ingredients

3. Repository (Permanent Storage)

Where Git permanently saves your changes
Complete history of all your work
Like your recipe book where you keep successful recipes
